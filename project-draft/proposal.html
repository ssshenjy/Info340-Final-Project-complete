        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Many people face challenges when it comes to travel planning. Travelers often struggle to consolidate their travel information from various sources and platforms, which can lead to information overload and decision paralysis. The travel planner app serves as a reminder and allows users to maintain organization and effectively manage their travel plans, and other important details. It offers features that enable users to track their expenses and receive timely reminders throughout their journeys. The main object of our app is to provide travel timeline, travel todo lists and travel budgeting.</li>
            <li>An information technology problem in the travel planner space could be the poor users interface and navigation experience. The app may lack of user-centric design, inconsistent navigation, and overwhelming interface. The main objective of the project is to enhance the travel planner app by providing three main services, travel timeline, travel todo lists and travel budgeting. We attempt to provide a comprehensive schedule template for users to fill in their daily itineraries. The app aims to offer a user-friendly interface where users can input their timeline, to-do lists, notes, and other relevant information for each day of their trip. Additionally, the app allows users to easily add event details to their schedules for planned activities. Furthermore, the travel planner app addresses potential issues where users may have missed booking certain accommodations, forgot to secure return plane tickets, or left certain days without planned destinations of interest. To mitigate these concerns, the app highlights any missing information and sends reminders to users, prompting them to fill in the necessary details later. This approach ensures that users can work on their travel plans over an extended period, allowing them to come back to the app even after a week and easily catch up on any pending tasks. Ultimately, the objective is to minimize the chances of missing important details and ensure that no essential aspects of the travel plan are left behind. In addition, travel budgeting services provide individuals or groups with tools and resources to plan and manage their travel expenses effectively. These services aim to help travelers create realistic budgets, track their spending by an inner calculater, and make informed financial decisions throughout their trip.</li>
            <li>One previous attempt to solve the problem of the poor user interface and navigation experience is through user research and usability testing. One way to do so is to conduct user surveys, interviews, and usability testing sessions to gather feedback and identify pain pointsand then collect valuable insights on user preferences, expectations, and difficulties faced while navigating the app.</li>

        <p>
            Potential users for the application are travelers pursuing a seamless and enjoyable vacation or business travels with a well-planned traveler plan. Individual travelers who are planning to travel without a travel agency can plan their destination of interest in the view of a calendar for the most personalized experience. Those who are seeking for efficient organization and the ability to work on their plans over a longer time span without going back and forth to ensure no dates are left out without a place to stay are highly encouraged to take advantage of the features of this web app. Users seek a solution to reduce tension and pressure of planning a trip by keeping their scattered notes in one place and releasing pressure on attention to detail. The information the users will be viewing will be based on the input provided by the users themselves. The app can thereby present information in an easily accessible manner, serving the objective of informing the user of their existing scheduled events and highlighting any missing events that need to be added.

            Planning a trip can often be complicated, involving extensive research, revising planned destinations, and booking hotels and activities on multiple platforms for each day of the trip. With the help of this web application, users can simplify the process. They can accumulate ideas and destinations over a longer time span, ensuring nothing is forgotten. By viewing the empty spots in their itinerary, users were reminded to fill-in those gaps and prompted to book hotels for specific days, thereby reducing the chances of missing important details or encountering last-minute challenges and ensuring a hassle-free trip planning experience.
